## Project Introduction ##

Goal: The main scientific goal is to probe the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) chemistry on higher Miller index surface facets of RuO2 by simulating the adsorption of O, OH, H, OOH, OO, and H2O on various active sites. With the data generated, we aim to construct thermodynamic stability diagrams relative to bulk-cleaved surfaces and identify the most stable surface configurations as my group frequently does. Note, we will not consider defected surfaces due to the significantly increased workload they would impose. Students will compare their simulated nanoparticle models with experimentally derived nanoparticles, providing insights into the stability and morphology of nanoparticles during electrochemical processes.

1. We will break into groups of 3 students
2. Each group will be assigned a series of surfaces they will be responsible for
       a. {(0,1,2),(0,2,1),(2,1,0)}
       b. {(2,2,1),(3,3,1),(4,4,1)}
       c. {(1,2,2),(1,3,3),(1,4,4)}
       d. {(1,1,2),(1,1,3),(1,1,4)}
       e. {(2,1,1),(3,1,1),(4,1,1)}
