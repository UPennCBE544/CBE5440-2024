## Project Introduction ##

Goal: The main scientific goal is to probe the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) chemistry on higher Miller index surface facets of RuO<sub>2</sub> by simulating the adsorption of O, OH, H, OOH, OO, and H<sub>2</sub>O on various active sites. With the data generated, we aim to construct thermodynamic stability diagrams relative to bulk-cleaved surfaces and identify the most stable surface configurations as my group frequently does. Note, we will not consider defected surfaces due to the significantly increased workload they would impose. Students will compare their simulated nanoparticle models with experimentally derived nanoparticles, providing insights into the stability and morphology of nanoparticles during electrochemical processes.

### Motivation ###

<a name='MO'></a>
- **Nanoparticle Shape Control and Optimization**: By modeling nanoparticle shapes, we gain insight into how environmental conditions (pH, applied potential, temperature, pressure, etc.) and chemical composition influence facet exposure and shape. This could lead to optimization strategies that improve catalyst activity and stability by tuning facet ratios and crystal morphology.

- **Catalyst Design for Functional Efficiency**: Selecting catalysts with the right functional properties is crucial for enabling manufacturable technologies. This includes considerations for cost efficiency, performance, durability, raw material abundance, and environmental impact.

- **Sustainable Energy Applications**: The function we are designing for is the oxygen evolution reaction. A deeper understanding of nanocrystal stability and activity supports the advancement of stable and active electrocatalysts, which are essential for sustainable hydrogen fuel generation and other clean energy technologies.

1. We will break into groups of 3 students
   
3. Each group will be assigned a series of surfaces they will be responsible for
   
       a. {(0,1,2),(0,2,1),(2,1,0)}

       b. {(2,2,1),(3,3,1),(4,4,1)}

       c. {(1,2,2),(1,3,3),(1,4,4)}

       d. {(1,1,2),(1,1,3),(1,1,4)}

       e. {(2,1,1),(3,1,1),(4,1,1)}
